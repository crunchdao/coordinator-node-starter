# Deprecated: condorgame_backend

This package is kept only as a legacy compatibility reference.

- It is **deprecated**.
- It is **not copied into runtime Docker images**.
- Active runtime and new development are in:
  - `coordinator_core/`
  - `node_template/`

If you are implementing or changing behavior, update `node_template/` and `coordinator_core/` only.
