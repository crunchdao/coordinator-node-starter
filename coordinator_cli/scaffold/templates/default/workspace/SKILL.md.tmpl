# [[name]] workspace skill

## Fast path (from workspace root)

```bash
cd [[node_name]]
make deploy
make verify-e2e
make logs-capture
```

## Where logs and diagnostics live

- Live service logs: `cd [[node_name]] && make logs`
- Captured runtime logs: `[[node_name]]/runtime-services.jsonl`
- Lifecycle audit: `process-log.jsonl`
- Additional troubleshooting: `[[node_name]]/RUNBOOK.md`

## Where to edit code

- Challenge behavior (model contract, inference, validation, scoring):
  `[[challenge_name]]/`
- Runtime wiring (.env/callables/schedules/deployment):
  `[[node_name]]/`
- Vendored runtime packages are under `[[node_name]]/runtime/`.
  Avoid editing them unless intentionally patching runtime internals.

## Validation after changes

```bash
cd [[node_name]]
make verify-e2e
```
