summary: Agent instructions for implementing challenge logic.

# Challenge skill - [[challenge_name]]

## Primary implementation files

- `[[package_module]]/tracker.py` — model interface (participants implement this)
- `[[package_module]]/scoring.py` — scoring function for local self-eval
- `[[package_module]]/examples/` — quickstarter implementations

## Runtime contract (node-private)

- `../[[node_name]]/runtime_definitions/contracts.py` — CrunchContract defining types, scoring, emission

## Development guidance

- Keep participant-facing challenge logic in this package.
- Keep runtime contracts and deployment config in `../[[node_name]]/`.
- The scoring function in `scoring.py` is used for local self-eval.
  The runtime scoring callable is configured in `contracts.py`.

## Validate from node workspace

```bash
cd ../[[node_name]]
make verify-e2e
```
