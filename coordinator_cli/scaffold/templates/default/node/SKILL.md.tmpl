# Node skill - [[node_name]]

## Primary commands

```bash
make deploy
make verify-e2e
make logs
make logs-capture
make down
```

## Logs and artifacts

- `make logs` streams all service logs from docker compose.
- `make logs-capture` writes structured logs to `runtime-services.jsonl`.
- Use `RUNBOOK.md` for known failure modes and recovery.

## Runtime checks

- Health: `http://localhost:8000/healthz`
- Models: `http://localhost:8000/reports/models`
- Leaderboard: `http://localhost:8000/reports/leaderboard`

## Edit boundaries

- Node-specific config: `.local.env`, `config/callables.env`,
  `config/scheduled_prediction_configs.json`, `deployment/`.
- Runtime callables live under `runtime_definitions/`.
- Challenge implementation is mounted from `../[[challenge_name]]`.
